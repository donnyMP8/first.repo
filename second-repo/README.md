Houw to creat a repo 

 Go to: github.com/newLinks to an external site., while logged in to GitHub.

Enter a name for your repository in the "Repository name" field. You can name it whatever you'd like; be creative! You can leave the remaining options as they are â€” the default options are fine. Click the green 'Create repository' button.

After you create the remote repository, you should see a "Quick setup" box at the top of the page. Make sure the 'SSH' option is selected, then click the copy button next to the repo URL to copy the URL.
